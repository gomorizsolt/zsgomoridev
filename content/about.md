# About Me

Heya, it's **Zsolt**! I'm a freelance software engineer located in Debrecen, Hungary. I focus on web development, particularly within the **Vue.js/Nuxt.js** ecosystem. In recent years, I've also delved deeply into **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and a range of modern frontend technologies. I'm an **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**, though I haven't yet had many chances to put my cloud knowledge into practice.

I'm dedicated to writing clean, efficient code, identifying optimal solutions for any given challenge and building codebases that are future-proof. Additionally, Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning and refining my skills to stay ahead in the field.

Outside of coding, I like staying active through sports. My activities vary with the weather, but I enjoy running, hiking, swimming, cycling, and occasionally playing tennis. My hobbies also include playing board games, watching basketball or heading out for a spontaneous weekend adventure.
