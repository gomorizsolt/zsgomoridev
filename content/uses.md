# Uses

A list of essential tools powering my workdays. Inspired by [Wes Bos' uses page](https://wesbos.com/uses).

## Workstation

### 2022 MacBook Air M2 512/16

My reliable companion when it comes to client work, personal projects or simply surfing the web. It's super portable, lightweight, yet powerful enough to suit all my needs.

### Yaasa Standing Desk

I couldn't find the exact same model still being sold, but I've been rocking my standing desk from Yaasa **for a few years now** and **had no issues so far**. It's sturdy, made from premium materials and has smart controls with memory function for two height presets.

### Yaasa Chair Classic

Super adjustable regular office chair with great back support.

### Samsung CJ89 43" Ultra-Wide Monitor

It features a **curved** design with **32:10** aspect ratio, **3840 x 1200** resolution and **120 Hz** refresh rate. It's also equipped with several ports, including two USB Type-C, which enable the super convenient single cable setups.

### Keychron K2 Keyboard

This is my first ever mechanical keyboard, equipped with the **Brown switches** for a gentle sound level. It features a built-in battery and can be paired up to **three devices**.

### Logitech MX Master 3s

Highly customisable wired/wireless mouse. It can connect to up to **three** devices and be charged through USB Type-C.

### Sony WH-1000XM5

My main driver when it comes to client meetings and listening to music, featuring a sleek design and a button to toggle between **ANC** and **Transparency Mode**. It also offers touch controls to, for instance, play/pause, increase/decrease volume, skip to the previous/next track and more.

### Apple AirPods Pro 2

Primarily used outdoors for music, podcasts or calls. Similarly to my Sony Headphones, it boasts **ANC**, **Transparency mode** and touch sensors.

### iPhone 15 128 GB

Base model, nothing too fancy. I have it paired with a [**Woodcessories Bio Leather Case**](https://en.woodcessories.com/products/iphone-15-leather-case-vegan-brown), as well as a [**Satechi Vegan-Leather Magnetic Wallet Stand**](https://satechi.net/products/vegan-leather-magnetic-wallet-stand) for holding my ID cards.

### iPad Mini (6th generation, 256 GB)

It's occasionally used to figure out solutions to complex work-related problems by sketching out some ideas in some notes app with **Apple Pencil**.

### HomePod mini

It only has one use-case at the moment - listening to music. In the future, I'd like to buy another one and connect the two to my TV for a better sound experience.

### Satechi Echo-Leather Desk Mat

I'm really pleased with this product. Despite the fact that it's a couple years old, it remains free of scratches, stains, or any other flaws.

### Oakywood Laptop Dock

Since my monitor takes up so much space, there's no room for a laptop stand. So I've invested in a **Dock from Oakywood**. Premium materials and minimalistic design - just what I needed.
